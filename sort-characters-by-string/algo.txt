Naive approach
1. Convert string in lowercase
2. Sort using any O(nlogn) algorithm like merge Sort or quick Sort

Time complexity - O(nlogn)
Space complexity - O(1)

Optimal approach
1. Convert string in lowercase
2.  Store the frequency of all characters in object
3.  Create a output string
4.  Traverse the object and insert characters according to their frequency (object stores keys in alphabetical order)

Time complexity - O(n)
Space complexity - O(1) (As number of characters are fixed for any size of input that is 26)
