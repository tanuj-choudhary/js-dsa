// Bruteforce
1. Sort using sort function or any sorting algorithm

// Optimised
1. Count number of zeroes , ones and twos
2. Empty the original array
3. Add number of zeroes then ones and then twos to the array

// Further optimised using only 1 pass
1.  Initialise 3 iterables low=0, high= length of array-1, mid=1

2.  while mid <= high
3.      If arr[mid] is 0
4.          swap value at arr[mid] and arr[low]
5.          Increase low by 1
6.          Increase mid by 1      

7.      if arr[mid] is 2
8.          swap value at arr[mid] and arr[high]
9.          Decrease high by 1

10.     if arr[mid] is 1
11.         Increase mid by 1
