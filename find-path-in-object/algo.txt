Split the string with dot as seperator into array of keys
Create a flag keyExist nad set it to true
Traverse the keys:
    If (obj exists and obj[key] doesn't equal to undefined)
        Set obj to obj[key]
    else
        Set keyExist to false and break
if(keyExists):
    Return newObj          
else:
    Return undefined
